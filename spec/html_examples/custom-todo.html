<p class="title">custom-todo.org</p>
<p>I copied this todo sequence from Worg. It shows a lot of power of the
built-in todo functionality. Now, let&#8217;s make sure all of these are
recognized (and therefore NOT exported.)</p>
<h1><span class="todo-keyword TODO">TODO </span>Sample</h1>
<ul>
  <li>State &#8220;CANCELED&#8221;   from &#8220;INPROGRESS&#8221; [2009-12-29 Tue 22:26] &#92;
I gave up.
  </li>
  <li>State &#8220;WAITING&#8221;    from &#8220;&#8221;           [2009-12-29 Tue 22:25] &#92;
huh?
  </li>
</ul>
<h1><span class="todo-keyword INPROGRESS">INPROGRESS </span>this one&#8217;s in progress</h1>
<h1><span class="todo-keyword WAITING">WAITING </span>who am I waiting on?</h1>
<h1><span class="todo-keyword DONE">DONE </span>Finished this one!</h1>
<h1><span class="todo-keyword CANCELED">CANCELED </span>I gave up here.</h1>
<h1>DONT be fooled by just a random word in all caps.</h1>
<h1>todo &lt;== this word doesn&#8217;t match because the case doesn&#8217;t match.</h1>
<h1>TODOX</h1>
<p>don&#8217;t be fooled by the initial substring above!</p>
