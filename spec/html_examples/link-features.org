#+TITLE: link-features.org

Org-mode export supports a lot of link features. I've covered "simple"
HTML links elsewhere. Now let's cover links to other org files, other
sections within documents, etc.

* Links to other org files

  This is a link to the ~code-comment.org~ file in the same
  directory. In ~emacs~, if you click it, the other file opens. We
  want the same behavior in the HTML export.

  [[file:code-comment.org][Code Comment]]

* Search links

  This is a search link into code-comment.org.

  [[file:code-comment.org::*Code%20Comment][Code Comment]]

* Correct handling of .org URIs in HTML markup routine (thanks @rayl!)

- [[http://foo.com][foo.com website]]

- [[http://foo.org][foo.org website]]

- [[http://foo.org/foo.org][foo.org/foo.org]]

- [[http://localhost:4567/foo.org][localhost:4567/foo.org]]

* In these links, .org is converted to .html

- [[file:path.org][file:path.org label]]

- [[file:notes/path.org][file:notes/path.org label]]

* Links abbreviations

  URLs can be abbreviated by a LINK definition in the org file

#+LINK: example http://example.com/something

[[example][This is an abbreviated link example]]
