h2. Anatomy of a BVP

Each BVP followed a simple, one-page template with the following
parts:

* Customer Summary
* Storyboard
* Requirements
* Partner teams

The following sections walk through each section and give an
example from one of our BVPs, "Resource-Smart Virtualization
Infrastructure":http://windows/hyper-v/initiatives/Value%20Propositions/DynamicDatacenter-ValueProp.docx (also called _Dynamic Datacenter_).
