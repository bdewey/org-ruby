h1. Block Code

I need to get block code examples working. In @orgmode@, they look
like this:

bc.. 
    def initialize(output)
      @output = output
      @buffer = ""
      @output_type = :start
      @list_indent_stack = []
      @paragraph_modifier = nil

      @logger = Logger.new(STDERR)
      @logger.level = Logger::WARN
    end


p. And now I should be back to normal text.

Putting in another paragraph for good measure.

Code should also get cancelled by a list, thus:

bc.. This is my code!

Another line!

* My list should cancel this.
* Another list line.
