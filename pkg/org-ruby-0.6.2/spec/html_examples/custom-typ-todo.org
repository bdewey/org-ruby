#+DESCRIPTION: Makes sure I can handle custom todo entries
#+TYP_TODO:   TODO(t) INPROGRESS(i) WAITING(w@) | DONE(d) CANCELED(c@)
#+OPTIONS:    todo:t

I copied this todo sequence from Worg. It shows a lot of power of the
built-in todo functionality. Now, let's make sure all of these are
recognized (and therefore NOT exported.)

* TODO Sample

  - State "CANCELED"   from "INPROGRESS" [2009-12-29 Tue 22:26] \\
    I gave up.
  - State "WAITING"    from ""           [2009-12-29 Tue 22:25] \\
    huh?

* INPROGRESS this one's in progress
* WAITING who am I waiting on?
* DONE Finished this one!
* CANCELED I gave up here.
* DONT be fooled by just a random word in all caps.
* todo <== this word doesn't match because the case doesn't match.
* TODOX
  don't be fooled by the initial substring above!
