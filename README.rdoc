== DESCRIPTION:

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Converts org-mode files to HTML or Textile
* Supports tables, block quotes, and block code
* Supports bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and code inline formatting.
* Supports hyperlinks that are in double-brackets
* Supports +.org+ views in Rails through Tilt.
* Upcoming: Handle export options specified in the org buffer.

== SYNOPSIS:

From the command line:

     org-ruby sample.org

...will output a HTML version of sample.org.

     org-ruby --translate textile sample.org

...will output a textile version of sample.org.

From Ruby code:

     Orgmode::Parser.new(data)

...will construct a new +Parser+ object.

== INSTALL:

sudo gem install org-ruby
